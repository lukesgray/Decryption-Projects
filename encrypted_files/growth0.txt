what is the definition of a growth mindset?
a growth mindset is “the understanding that abilities and understanding 
can be developed” (mindset works, n.d.). those with a growth mindset believe 
that they can get smarter, more intelligent, and more talented through putting 
in time and effort.

what is a fixed mindset?
on the flipside, a fixed mindset is one that assumes abilities and 
understanding are relatively fixed. those with a fixed mindset may not 
believe that intelligence can be enhanced, or that you either “have it or 
you don’t” when it comes to abilities and talents.

what is the main difference (growth mindset vs. fixed)?
the main difference between the two mindsets is the belief in the 
permanence of intelligence and ability; one views it as very permanent, 
with little to no room for change in either direction, while the other 
views it as more changeable, with opportunities for improvement (or, for 
that matter, regression).

this difference in mindset may lead to marked differences in behavior as 
well. if someone believes intelligence and abilities are immutable traits, 
they are not likely to put in much effort to change their inherent 
intelligence and abilities. on the other hand, those who believe they can 
change these traits may be much more willing to put in extra time and 
effort to achieve more ambitious goals. with a growth mindset, individuals 
may achieve more than others because they are worrying less about seeming 
smart or talented and putting more of their energy into learning (dweck, 2016).
